## Project State (updated: 2026-03-10)

**Simulator**: v6, 2683 lines, functional — deployed on GitHub Pages
**Pipeline A**: Complete (786×43 epoch DB, 500-program DB, JIT+AOT models)
**Pipeline B**: Complete (6 Dune queries → D.daily + D.dailyNet injected)
**Google Sheets export**: Deferred (replaced by HTML simulator)

---

## In Progress
<!-- Fill at the start of each session -->
- [ ] Complete agent/workflow setup (place files, verify /agents, commit)

## ⚠️ NEXT AFTER CLEANUP — Revenue Allocation Model Correction (STAGED)

**Priority: implement immediately after agent/workflow setup is complete.**

This is a conceptual model correction that changes the waterfall logic for both AOT and JIT.
Full specification is in `tasks/lessons.md` under "Revenue Model — Core Waterfall Correction".

Summary of what must change in the simulator and Python models:
- [ ] Rename "commission" → "Protocol Take Rate" everywhere in simulator sliders/labels
- [ ] Fix waterfall: rebates and validator bonus come OUT OF protocol take, not gross revenue
- [ ] Add guard: if protocol take rate = 0, rebate and validator bonus must be forced to 0
- [ ] Separate AOT and JIT parameter panels (AOT has validator bonus, JIT does not)
- [ ] Update all tooltips, labels, and formula comments to reflect correct structure
- [ ] Update `03_model/jit_revenue.py` and `aot_revenue.py` waterfall logic
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` → Protocol Constants section
- [ ] Update `DATA_LINEAGE.md` if output columns are renamed

## To Do — Features

### Tab 1: Revenue Model
- [ ] Improve AOT scenario calculations
- [ ] Add Trillium real-time data source
- [ ] Refresh epoch data (Pipeline A)

### Tab 2: AOT Block Simulator
- [ ] [Features to define]

### Tab 3: Solana General Data
- [ ] [Features to define]

### Infrastructure / Pipeline
- [ ] Set up automatic Dune data refresh
- [ ] [Other pipeline tasks]

## Recently Completed

- [x] Pipeline A complete — epoch DB 786×43, program DB 500×23 ✅
- [x] Pipeline B complete — 6 Dune batch queries, temporal injection ✅
- [x] Simulator v6 — D.daily + D.dailyNet injected ✅
- [x] Revenue models — JIT + AOT (top-down + bottom-up) ✅
- [x] Conditions pipeline — market condition × program analysis ✅
- [x] Revenue model column bugs fixed — March 2026 ✅

---

## Blocked / Waiting

- [ ] Google Sheets export — `04_output/sheets_export.py` (deferred, low priority)
- [ ] BigQuery × Token Terminal — GCP setup too heavy, deferred
- [ ] Token Terminal for Sheets — not needed for core revenue model
